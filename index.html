          <h1> Message from Board and Staff </h1>
          <p> In 2015, our riders continued to have an immense impact on the affordable housing cause, granting over $637,000 to 380 affordable housing organizations across the United States. We celebrated the launch of Drift West, Bike & Build’s newest regional route that engages unique housing nonprofits throughout the Pacific Northwest. We established a partnership with YouthBuild Philadelphia, connecting their young adults to cycling and furthering their impressive record of service. Projects fully or partially funded by Bike & Build produced over 1,100 new homes for individuals and families across the U.S. And we launched the brand new bikeandbuild.org!
          </p>
          <p> We are extremely proud of the impact our 370 riders and four staff had in 2015, but those accomplishments are shadowed by a collision between a distracted motorist and two of our Maine to Santa Barbara cyclists.  While riding in Oklahoma, Patrick Wanninkhof and Bridget Anderson were struck from behind by a driver looking at her cell phone. Patrick passed away at the scene and Bridget suffered severe injuries. In an age where mobile devices are ubiquitous and create increased danger for cyclists, Bike & Build’s Board of Directors underwent a rigorous evaluation of the organization’s safety protocols – its recommendations are already being implemented.
          </p>
          <p> The challenges and successes of 2015 were surmountable and achievable only because of the support we received from our alumni, hosts, donors, and grantees.  It is the strength of our community that keeps the wheels turning and hammers swinging. We look forward to seeing you in 2016.
          </p>

              <h2>Scholarships</h2>
              <p> Bike & Build continued to expand our scholarship program in 2015. For the first time, we offered scholarships for our cross-country rides. Kevin Pham (CUS) received a scholarship provided on behalf of the Chris Webber Memorial Fund.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                The best part about Bike & Build is the supportive alumni family that you become adopted into after the trip. When I meet up with riders from the other routes, they always radiate good vibes
              </blockquote>
              Kenya Wright (C2C) was a partial scholarship winner through the Patrick Zuza Scholarship. “I love Bike and Build!” Kenya said after the trip.

              <blockquote>It gave me the greatest sense of accomplishment, challenged my mind and body to the extreme, and taught me how to genuinely support others.</blockquote>

              Bernard Long was the recipient of the Bike & Build Drift Scholarship, earning support to complete Coastal Drift.
              <blockquote>
                Because of this trip, I was able to understand the importance of community, volunteering, listening, and the value of my work. I was able to interact with people that I normally would not meet and see places that I normally would not go to.
              </blockquote>

            <h2> YouthBuild Ride </h2>
            <p> As part of continued efforts to promote diversity on Bike & Build trips and expand our programming to underserved young adults, in 2015 we partnered with YouthBuild Philadelphia to create Bike & YouthBuild. YouthBuild is a natural partner for Bike & Build: it provides high school dropouts with a chance to earn their diplomas while learning job skills in valuable community services, particularly building affordable homes for low-income Philadelphia residents.</p>
            <p>Staff and students of YB Philly came together with B&B alums throughout the spring on local bike trails and YouthBuild construction sites. The program culminated in May with four days of riding and building in both Philadelphia and Washington, DC. (A special thank you to Fairmount Bicycles for donating bikes for the students to rent throughout the program.) In total, 27 YBers and B&Bers pedaled 800 cumulative miles.</p>
            <!-- Quote from YBer? Matt working on it -->
            <blockquote>
              “I had a great time on Bike &amp; YouthBuild. I hadn’t been on a bike in long time, and it was a really cool to ride in Philly and DC.”
              <span class="author"> Max Hough, YouthBuild Philly student</span>
            </blockquote>
            <p> YouthBuild’s mission of investing in opportunity youth to transform their lives and communities through service, education, and leadership mirrors Bike &amp; Build’s goal of empowering young adults for a lifetime of service and civic engagement. Bike & Build looks forward to building a long-term relationship with YouthBuild, in both Philadelphia and their other many wonderful affiliates.

          <h2> Drift Expansion </h2>
          <p> In 2015, the East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry became even more fierce. Building on the success of Coastal Drift, Bike &amp; Build’s three-week regional route in New England, we developed Drift West – a route that mirrors the Coastal Drift model and runs from Portland, OR to Bellingham, WA. Drift West quickly actualized into a three-week powerhouse – the roster was full, the scenery was impeccable, five new and unique affordable housing organizations were tapped, and, like its predecessor, Drift West re-engaged alumni and attracted new riders who otherwise would be unable to participate in Bike & Build. Unphased by its friendly rival, Coastal Drift avoided the proverbial sophomore slump as it bounded down the East Coast with great success. One summer, two Drifts. Catch your breath and catch the Drift.

            <p>In 2015, Bike & Build granted $637,311 to 380 affordable housing organizations across the United States. That included $368,000 in competitive grants to organizations that applied to our riders for direct funding on projects that engage young adults in addressing the affordable housing cause. These three organizations are just a sampling of the many innovative projects making a meaningful impact that funded by Bike & Build in 2015. </p>

            <h2> GRID Alternatives North Valley </h2>
            <h3> Chico, CA - Funded by South Carolina to Santa Cruz - $7,380</h3>
            <p>The Women in Solar, Youth Leadership Program empowers female college engineering students to take a leading role in making real-world green affordable housing solutions available in northern California.  The Project engages college students in semester-long training and mentorship with GRID. The women then plan and design a solar installation for a low-income family and teach and engage high school youth as they install the system.</p>
            <blockquote cite="http://">
              “We are really excited about Bike & Build’s support. It brings resources that weren’t available to our academic partners,” said Rebekah Casey, GRID’s Director of Development and Strategic Partnerships. Bike & Build’s funding will help GRID engage ten college students and over 20 high schoolers in designing and building a system in 2016.

            <blockquote cite="http://">
              “It’s a chance for us to make impact on multiple levels. We of course work with groups who are underserved economically, and there is an underrepresentation of women in the engineering field that we’re addressing.”

            <h2> Rebuilding Together Philadelphia </h2>
            <h3> Philadelphia, PA - Funded by Connecticut to California - $9,000 </h3>

            <p>The Medically Fragile Children’s Project, a new project for Rebuilding Together Philadelphia (RTP), will provide free home repairs for low-income families of medically fragile, impoverished children. RTP is partnering with high schools in vocational training and with non-high school graduates aged 18 to 21 working towards their GED. The partnership not only completes much-needed home repairs for low-income residents of Philadelphia, but also gives local students the opportunity for real-world job experience. </p>
            <blockquote cite="http://">
            “Bike & Build’s support is essential to working with our vocational students,” said Stefanie Seldin, Executive Director for RTP. “When we have large block builds, we have a lot of sponsors who support us financially. Obviously, we can’t ask vocational schools for that same support, given the poor funding status of schools right now. Grants from organizations like Bike & Build is the only source of funding a project like this can receive.” </blockquote>
            <p> The data appears to affirm the value of this experience for young adult volunteers. While Philadelphia’s schools graduate about 70% of its students, those who participate in vocational training like this partnership with RTP see closer to a 90% rate. Bike & Build is proud to support RTP’s impact in our hometown.</p>

            <h2> Santa Fe Habitat for Humanity </h2>
            <h3>Santa Fe, NM – Funded by Southern US - $9,000 </h3>

            <p>Every year, Santa Fe Habitat builds six or seven homes, and each one of them incorporates youth volunteers into its construction. Bike & Build’s grant will help frame and roof a home for a Santa Fe family through a partnership with 30 young adults from the Santa Fe YouthWorks/Youth Build program. B&B funds have also helped to leverage other funds to support the project.</p>
            <p>In 2015, riders on the Southern US route volunteered for two build days with Santa Fe Habitat for Humanity. “We always look forward to having the riders to our sites,” said Marilyn Perryman, SFHfH’s Director of Development & Marketing. “They get to work directly with these kids and spend time with them throughout the day. Really enhances the experience for both groups and allows Bike & Build to see the value we’re bringing to these young adults and the families we serve.”</p>
            <p>A special congratulations to Santa Fe Habitat for completing their 100th home this year. They have plans for many more, having recently purchased 19 new properties on which to build over the next three years.</p>
