        <h3 class=""> Message from Board and Staff </h3>
        <div class="measure">
          <p> In 2015, our riders continued to have an immense impact on the affordable housing cause, granting over $637,000 to 380 affordable housing organizations across the United States. We celebrated the launch of Drift West, Bike & Build’s newest regional route that engages unique housing nonprofits throughout the Pacific Northwest. We established a partnership with YouthBuild Philadelphia, connecting their young adults to cycling and furthering their impressive record of service. Projects fully or partially funded by Bike & Build produced over 1,100 new homes for individuals and families across the U.S. And we launched the brand new bikeandbuild.org!
          </p>
          <p> We are extremely proud of the impact our 370 riders and four staff had in 2015, but those accomplishments are shadowed by a collision between a distracted motorist and two of our Maine to Santa Barbara cyclists.  While riding in Oklahoma, Patrick Wanninkhof and Bridget Anderson were struck from behind by a driver looking at her cell phone. Patrick passed away at the scene and Bridget suffered severe injuries. In an age where mobile devices are ubiquitous and create increased danger for cyclists, Bike & Build’s Board of Directors underwent a rigorous evaluation of the organization’s safety protocols – its recommendations are already being implemented.
          </p>
          <p> The challenges and successes of 2015 were surmountable and achievable only because of the support we received from our alumni, hosts, donors, and grantees.  It is the strength of our community that keeps the wheels turning and hammers swinging. We look forward to seeing you in 2016.
          </p>
          <p> <strong> Kristin Anderson, </strong> Chair, Board of Directors </br>
              <strong> Natalie Serle’, </strong> Senior Program Director </br>

              One way that Bike & Build is unique to other non-profits is that we ask our volunteers to help us figure out where to spend the money.
              Many riders go out and raise money with a local bike ride, or a blank blank, or an placeholder text is super important.
              I love placeholder text.

                <p> In 2015, the East Coast vs. West Coast rivalry became even more fierce. Building on the success of Coastal Drift, Bike &amp; Build’s three-week regional route in New England, we developed Drift West – a route that mirrors the Coastal Drift model and runs from Portland, OR to Bellingham, WA. Drift West quickly actualized into a three-week powerhouse – the roster was full, the scenery was impeccable, five new and unique affordable housing organizations were tapped, and, like its predecessor, Drift West re-engaged alumni and attracted new riders who otherwise would be unable to participate in Bike & Build. Unphased by its friendly rival, Coastal Drift avoided the proverbial sophomore slump as it bounded down the East Coast with great success. One summer, two Drifts. Catch your breath and catch the Drift.

              <div class="column-count-2">
                <p> As part of continued efforts to promote diversity on Bike & Build trips and expand our programming to underserved young adults, in 2015 we partnered with YouthBuild Philadelphia to create Bike & YouthBuild. YouthBuild is a natural partner for Bike & Build: it provides high school dropouts with a chance to earn their diplomas while learning job skills in valuable community services, particularly building affordable homes for low-income Philadelphia residents.</p>
                <p>Staff and students of YB Philly came together with B&B alums throughout the spring on local bike trails and YouthBuild construction sites. The program culminated in May with four days of riding and building in both Philadelphia and Washington, DC. (A special thank you to Fairmount Bicycles for donating bikes for the students to rent throughout the program.) In total, 27 YBers and B&Bers pedaled 800 cumulative miles.</p>
                <p> YouthBuild’s mission of investing in opportunity youth to transform their lives and communities through service, education, and leadership mirrors Bike &amp; Build’s goal of empowering young adults for a lifetime of service and civic engagement. Bike & Build looks forward to building a long-term relationship with YouthBuild, in both Philadelphia and their other many wonderful affiliates.

                  Bike & Build’s support is essential to working with our vocational students.
                  When we have large block builds, we have a lot of sponsors who support us financially. Obviously, we can’t ask vocational schools for that same support, given the poor funding status of schools right now. Grants from organizations like Bike & Build is the only source of funding a project like this can receive.

                <p> <small class="caps"><strong>Stefanie Seldin</strong>,Executive Director for RTP.</small> </p>
                <p> The data appears to affirm the value of this experience for young adult volunteers. While Philadelphia’s schools graduate about 70% of its students, those who participate in vocational training like this partnership with RTP see closer to a 90% rate. Bike & Build is proud to support RTP’s impact in our hometown.</p>

                  <p>Every year, Santa Fe Habitat builds six or seven homes, and each one of them incorporates youth volunteers into its construction. Bike & Build’s grant will help frame and roof a home for a Santa Fe family through a partnership with 30 young adults from the Santa Fe YouthWorks/Youth Build program. B&B funds have also helped to leverage other funds to support the project.</p>
                  <p>In 2015, riders on the Southern US route volunteered for two build days with Santa Fe Habitat for Humanity. </p>

                  We always look forward to having the riders to our sites...They get to work directly with these kids and spend time with them throughout the day. Really enhances the experience for both groups and allows Bike & Build to see the value we’re bringing to these young adults and the families we serve.
